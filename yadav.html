                    <div class="me-content">I've always royed duep, heart-zone conversations Since I was young. I often wondered why people opened up so easy with me I saw mat pemaps I had a gift for asking the right questions, for making people feel safe and for listening for nicit just what was sad, but also what was left unsaid I began to see that everyone, without exception, yemed to be heard held and

                        understood.<br>
                        
                        These were some of the reasons that made me step into the world of coaching<br><br>
                        
                        Coaching conversations are powerful. They go deep. They get to the heart of the matter. They are bold. They can be transformative. And they can leave you feeling heard and held in way that you may never have exponenced before<br><br>
                        
                        I'm an ICF certified coach, having graduated from the Coaching For Transformation programin New York in 2018 Pror to that) did my Masters in Organization Studies from the Warwick Business School (2008) I started my coaching practice working with 12 Harvard Business School students and grew from there Session after session brought up these realizations<br><br>

                        We are a dying to be heard<br>
                        
                        Many of us struggle with feelings of guit, shame, and not being good enough<br><br>
                        
                        We often have no one to share with about the places where we are most vulnerable<br>
                        
                        We often wear masks Because inside we are termfied of not being loved and accepted just as we are<br>

         <p style="color:grey;">Different from therapy, Coaching involves a series of powerful conversations, that help you move forward towards your most cherished goals and, session by session, help you overcome the obstacles that stand in the way<br><br>

            We all have a default future. Coaching helps you design, and walk towards the future you truly desire<br><br>
            
            A coach will hear you, cheer you challenge you. And fiercely care for you.<br><br>
            
            A coach does not advise A coach helps draw your own best answers out of you, using the skills of deep listening, empowering questions, careful observation, brainstorming, insight and intuition. A coach will hold you accountable to your dreams<br>

This approach gives you the opportunity to reflect, take action steps and review progress each week It is ideal for clients who don't have an urgent issue but want clanty and movement in the stuck areas of their life<br><br>

                Or a one day coaching intensive- here we spend an entire day in powerful conversations We identify your goals, work with blocks and create a concrete action plan. Expect to feel immensely inspired by the end of the day. The intensive is especially useful for clients who come with pressing and urgent issues. This includes two follow-up conversations to keep the momentum going<br><br>
